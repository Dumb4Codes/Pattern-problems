Data Structures and Algorithms Pattern Problems

This repository contains a collection of pattern-based problems and solutions related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). These problems are commonly encountered in coding interviews and competitive programming contests and can help you improve your problem-solving skills.


#Introduction

Pattern-based problems in DSA involve recognizing and solving problems that can be broken down into repeating sequences or structures. These patterns can help you develop efficient algorithms and code.


#Problems-categories

The problems in this repository are organized into the following categories:

1. Number Patterns: Problems involving patterns of numbers or mathematical sequences.
2. String Patterns: Problems related to patterns within strings, such as palindromes or string manipulation.
3. Star Patterns: Problems that require printing patterns of stars or other characters.
4. Pyramid Patterns: Problems that involve creating pyramid-like patterns.
5. Other Patterns: Miscellaneous pattern problems that do not fit into the above categories.

Each category contains its own set of problems and solutions.
